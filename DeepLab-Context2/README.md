## DeepLab v2

### Introduction

DeepLab is a state-of-art deep learning system for semantic image segmentation built on top of [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org).

It combines (1) *atrous convolution* to explicitly control the resolution at which feature responses are computed within Deep Convolutional Neural Networks, (2) *atrous spatial pyramid pooling* to robustly segment objects at multiple scales with filters at multiple sampling rates and effective fields-of-views, and (3) densely connected conditional random fields (CRF) as post processing.

This distribution provides a publicly available implementation for the key model ingredients reported in our latest [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.00915).
It also contains implementations for **all** methods reported in all our previous papers.

### Performance

*DeepLabv2* currently achieves **79.7%** on the challenging PASCAL VOC 2012 semantic image segmentation task -- see the [leaderboard](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk:8080/leaderboard/displaylb.php?challengeid=11&compid=6). 

Please refer to our project [website](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab.html) for details.

### Pre-trained models

We have released several trained models and corresponding prototxt files at [here](http://liangchiehchen.com/projects/DeepLab_Models.html). Please check it for more model details.


### Cudnn Version
Works best with Cudnn4.

### Python wrapper requirements

1. Install wget library for python
```
sudo pip install wget
```
2. Change DATA_ROOT to point to the PASCAL images

3. To use the mat_read_layer and mat_write_layer, please download and install [matio](http://sourceforge.net/projects/matio/files/matio/1.5.2/).

### How to run DeepLab
python run.py

please note you need to define the paths and interested model in run.py
